# E-Commerce Chatbot Technical Documentation

## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 System Architecture

The e-commerce chatbot is built on a client-server architecture:

- **Frontend**: A web-based chatbot interface built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
- **Backend**: A Node.js server with Express.js framework
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing product data
- **API**: RESTful API to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend

### 1.2 Data Flow

1. User sends a message through the chatbot interface
2. Frontend JavaScript captures the message and sends it to the backend API
3. Backend processes the message and queries the database for relevant product information
4. Database returns product data to the backend
5. Backend formats the response and sends it back to the frontend
6. Frontend displays the response to the user

## 2. Technology Choices

### 2.1 Selected Technologies

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB

The technology stack was chosen based on:
- JavaScript across the entire stack for consistent development
- Strong ecosystem of packages and community support
- Flexibility and speed in development
- Suitability for building interactive web applications
