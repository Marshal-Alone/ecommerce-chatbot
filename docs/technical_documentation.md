# E-Commerce Chatbot Technical Documentation

## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Planned System Architecture

The e-commerce chatbot will be built on a client-server architecture:

- **Frontend**: A web-based chatbot interface built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
- **Backend**: A Node.js server with Express.js framework
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing product data
- **API**: RESTful API to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend

### 1.2 Planned Data Flow

1. User sends a message through the chatbot interface
2. Frontend JavaScript captures the message and sends it to the backend API
3. Backend processes the message and queries the database for relevant product information
4. Database returns product data to the backend
5. Backend formats the response and sends it back to the frontend
6. Frontend displays the response to the user

## 2. Technology Choices

### 2.1 Selected Technologies

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB

The technology stack was chosen based on:

- JavaScript across the entire stack for consistent development
- Strong ecosystem of packages and community support
- Flexibility and speed in development
- Suitability for building interactive web applications

## 3. Implementation Progress

### 3.1 Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation (Completed)

- Created project directory structure with:
  - Frontend folder for UI components
  - Backend folder with separation of concerns (routes, models, config)
  - Documentation folder
- Initialized project with npm
- Set up Git repository
- Created README.md with project overview
- Created initial technical documentation

### 3.2 Phase 1: Server Boilerplate (Completed)

#### 3.2.1 Express Server Configuration (`server.js`)

- Set up Express application
- Configured CORS for cross-origin requests
- Added middleware for JSON and URL-encoded request parsing
- Configured static file serving for frontend
- Set up basic API route structure

#### 3.2.2 Database Configuration (`config/database.js`)

- Implemented MongoDB connection with mongoose
- Added connection options for better performance and compatibility
- Implemented error handling for database connection issues
- Added event listeners for connection status monitoring


## 5. Challenges and Solutions

### 5.1 Server Configuration

- **Challenge**: Setting up a robust server configuration that handles errors gracefully
- **Solution**: Implemented async/await pattern with proper error handling and added event listeners for various connection states
